  Even though we keep it in our database, it can't be used to send out money from your wallet,
  because a small and important part of it has been extracted (marked with red stars).
  That part has been given to you as a pass code.
  Every time you make a new payment we ask you to provide it.
  Thus, even if our database gets hacked and/or stolen, your wallet is safe.
