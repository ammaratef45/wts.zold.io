    This is the private

      RSA key

  %p
    Even though we keep this private RSA key in our database, it can't be used to send out money from your wallet,
    because a small and important part of it has been extracted (marked with red stars).
    That part has been given to you as a pass code.
    Every time you make a new payment we ask you to provide it.
    Thus, even if our database gets hacked and/or stolen, your wallet is safe.

    Your wallet is not visible for us now.
    Please, do

      %a{href: '/pull'}
